	  This option enables the hardware independent IEEE 802.15.4
	  networking stack for SoftMAC devices (the ones implementing
	  only PHY level of IEEE 802.15.4 standard).

	  Note: this implementation is neither certified, nor feature
	  complete! We do not guarantee that it is compatible w/ other
	  implementations, etc.

	  If you plan to use HardMAC IEEE 802.15.4 devices, you can
	  say N here. Alternatievly you can say M to compile it as
	  module.

config MAC802154_DEBUG
	bool "IEEE 802.15.4 SoftMAC debugging messages"
	depends on MAC802154
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to make the IEEE 802.15.4 SoftMAC generate extensive
	  debugging messages.
